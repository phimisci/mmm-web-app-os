# Welcome!

Welcome to the Magic Manuscript Maker, the innovative typesetting tool of the [Philosophy and the Mind Sciences](https://philosophymindscience.org/) journal. With this intuitive web application, authors and editors can easily prepare and typeset their manuscripts for publication. Our goal is to simplify and accelerate the process of scientific publishing for editorial teams, allowing the technical aspects of publication (typesetting and production) to be done efficiently and automatically.

The Magic Manuscript Maker was being produced as part of a three-year DFG funding and is intended to effectively support the editorial team even after the funding phase ends. If you want to know more, please visit our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/phimisci).
