<h3>General</h3>
<p>The Magic Manuscript Maker is a tool utilized by the <a href="https://philosophymindscience.org/index.php/phimisci/index">Philosophy and the Mind Sciences</a> journal. It builds an integral part of the typesetting and article production phase. The primary development of this tool was led by <a href="https://website.tjurczyk.de/">Thomas Jurczyk</a> for the website and web application, and Felix Kopecky for LaTeX and PDF Rendering with Pandoc.</p>

<h3>Journal</h3>
<p>Philosophy and the Mind Sciences (PhiMiSci) focuses on the intersection between philosophy and the empirical mind sciences. PhiMiSci is a peer-reviewed, not-for-profit open-access journal that is free for authors and readers.</p>

<p>PhiMiSci is an independent publication, but builds on the success of the <a href="https://open-mind.net/">Open MIND</a> project (2015; Metzinger & Windt, eds.; also published by MIT Press) and the <a href="https://predictive-mind.net/">PPP</a> project (2017; Metzinger & Wiese, eds.). Both were peer-reviewed, open-access edited collections published independently of commercial publishers.</p>

<h3>Technical Details</h3>

<p>The Magic Manuscript Maker is based on a mix of Pandoc, Flask (Python), and Docker. The official Git repository is currently hosted on a private GitLab instance of the Ruhr-Universit√§t Bochum, but it is planned to be made accessible to a wider audience in the future.</p>
